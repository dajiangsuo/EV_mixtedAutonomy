    "# Tutorial 08: Creating Custom Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial walks you through the process of creating custom environments in Flow. Custom environments contain specific methods that define the problem space of a task, such as the state and action spaces of the RL agent and the signal (or reward) that the RL algorithm will optimize over. By specifying a few methods within a custom environment, individuals can use Flow to design traffic control tasks of various types, such as optimal traffic light signal timing and flow regulation via mixed autonomy traffic (see the figures below). Finally, these environments are compatible with OpenAI Gym.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rest of the tutorial is organized as follows: Section 1 discusses the process of creating an environment for mixed autonomy vehicle control where the autonomous vehicles perceive all vehicles in the network, and Section 2 implements the environment in simulation.\n",
